# Express_noteTaker

## Description
- This is a note-taker application build with JSON frontend and Express.ja backend. The initial page is presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. There is a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button in the navigation at the top of the page. The "Save Button" saves new note I have entered and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappears.
